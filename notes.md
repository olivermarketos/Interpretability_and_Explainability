Okay, seeing the extended training log confirms the pattern of instability. The erratic jumps in validation loss and accuracy, while the training loss generally decreases smoothly, are a classic sign that the model's generalization ability is fluctuating significantly from epoch to epoch.

Here's a breakdown of why this happens and how to limit it:

Why the Erratic Jumps Occur:

Overfitting within Epochs: The model might be overfitting to the specific batches seen during a particular training epoch. It learns patterns (including noise) that work well for the training data presented in that epoch but don't generalize to the unseen validation set. The next epoch presents slightly different data (due to shuffling and augmentation), and the model might learn slightly different, non-generalizable patterns, or recover.
Learning Rate Too High (Potentially Locally): Even if the overall learning rate seems okay (since the model is learning), it might be too high for certain points in the optimization process. This can cause the optimizer (Adam) to "overshoot" a good minimum in the loss landscape. It might jump into a region that looks good based on the current training batch's gradient but performs poorly on the validation set. The ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler helps correct this eventually (like after Epoch 7), but the jumps can still happen between LR reductions.
Noisy Gradients / Batch Variance: With a finite batch size (32), the gradient calculated for each step is an estimate of the true gradient over the entire dataset. Batch normalization helps stabilize activations, but the parameter updates themselves can still be noisy. Sometimes, a few "unlucky" batches might push the model weights in a direction that temporarily hurts validation performance.
Validation Set Sensitivity:
Size: If your validation set is relatively small, the misclassification of just a few examples can lead to noticeable percentage jumps in accuracy.
Representativeness: The specific examples in the validation set might be slightly different or contain edge cases that the model struggles with inconsistently depending on the specific features it learned in the preceding training epoch.
Interaction between Components: It's often an interplay. A slightly high LR combined with batch variance might cause the model to temporarily focus on non-generalizable features, leading to a validation dip.
How to Limit the Erratic Jumps (Improve Stability and Generalization):

Stronger Regularization (Most Likely Solution): This discourages the model from fitting noise and encourages learning more robust features.
Weight Decay: This is often very effective. Add weight_decay to your optimizer definition. It adds a penalty to the loss based on the magnitude of the weights. Start with a small value like 1e-5 or 1e-4.
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
    model.parameters(),
    lr=config['learning_rate'],
    weight_decay=1e-5 # Add this
)
# Or consider AdamW which handles weight decay slightly differently/better
# optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=config['learning_rate'], weight_decay=1e-5)
Use code with caution.
Python
Increase Dropout: You have fc_dropout=0.5. If the instability persists, you could try slightly increasing it (e.g., 0.6), but weight decay is often a better first step. Also, ensure you are using Dropout2d in the convolutional blocks if specified in your config (as discussed previously), as this provides spatial regularization.
More/Better Data Augmentation: Review your train_transforms. Are they sufficient and appropriate for X-rays?
Consider adding transforms.RandomAffine (rotation, translation, shear).
Ensure your current augmentations (RandomRotation(15), RandomHorizontalFlip, ColorJitter) are strong enough but medically plausible. Too much geometric distortion could potentially harm learning if not careful.
Tune Learning Rate and Scheduler:
Lower Initial Learning Rate: Your current LR (0.0001) might still be a bit aggressive, leading to overshooting. Try halving it to 5e-5 or even 2e-5.
Adjust ReduceLROnPlateau:
Increase patience: Maybe patience=3 or 4 instead of 2. This gives the model more epochs to potentially recover before cutting the LR.
Decrease factor: Use factor=0.5 instead of 0.2 for a less drastic LR reduction. A large drop (like x0.2) can sometimes destabilize training temporarily.
Increase Batch Size: If your GPU memory allows, try increasing the batch size (e.g., to 64). This leads to more stable gradient estimates and potentially smoother BatchNorm statistics, which can reduce epoch-to-epoch variance. However, sometimes larger batch sizes can lead to sharper minima which generalize slightly worse (a known trade-off).
Gradient Clipping: You already have clip_grad_norm_ with max_norm=1.0. This helps prevent exploding gradients but doesn't directly address the overfitting/generalization instability as much as regularization or LR tuning. It's generally good to keep it.
Early Stopping (Implicitly Done): Your current code saves the best model based on val_loss. This is effectively a form of early stopping, ensuring you retain the model state that generalized best, even if subsequent epochs performed worse on the validation set. This mitigates the impact of the instability on your final usable model.
Recommended Steps:

Add Weight Decay: Start with weight_decay=1e-5 in your Adam optimizer. This is often the single most impactful change for improving stability and generalization.
Check Validation Set Size: Ensure your validation set is reasonably large (ideally hundreds, if not thousands, of images depending on dataset difficulty) for stable metrics.
Lower Learning Rate: If weight decay alone isn't enough, try reducing the initial learning_rate to 5e-5.
Adjust Scheduler: Consider increasing patience or using a gentler factor if instability persists after LR adjustments.
Review Augmentations: Ensure they are appropriate and possibly add more diversity if needed.
By applying these techniques, particularly regularization (weight decay) and potentially tuning the learning rate, you should be able to achieve smoother and more consistent validation performance.
